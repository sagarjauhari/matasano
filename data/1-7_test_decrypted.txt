It was a long laboratory of unusual size in which Randall found himself, one in
which every variety of physical and electrical apparatus seemed represented.
Three huge dynamo-motor arrangements took up the room's far end, and from them a
tangle of wiring led through square black condensers and transformers to a
battery of great tubes. Most remarkable, though, was the object at the room's
center.

It was like a great double cube of dull metal, being in effect two metal cubes
each twelve feet square, supported a few feet above the floor by insulated
standards. One side of each cube was open, exposing the hollow interiors of the
two cubical chambers. Other wiring led from the big electronic tubes and from
the dynamos to the sides of the two cubes.

The four men gazed at the enigmatic thing for a time in silence. Milton's
strong, capable face showed only in its steady eyes what feelings were his, but
Lanier's younger countenance was alight[6] with excitement; and so too to some
degree was that of Nelson. Randall simply stared at the thing, until Milton
nodded toward it.
"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,"That," he said,
"That," he said, "is what will flash us out to Mars to-night."

Randall could only turn his stare upon the other, and Lanier chuckled. "Can't
take it in yet, Randall? Well, neither could I when the idea was first sprung on
us."
